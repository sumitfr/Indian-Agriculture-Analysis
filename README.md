# Indian-Agriculture-Analysis
ðŸŒ¾ **Agriculture Production Analysis â€“ Power BI**
ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

Agriculture is a cornerstone of Indiaâ€™s economy, and analyzing production trends helps optimize resources and improve farming strategies. This project explores multi-state agricultural data to study the impact of cultivated area, rainfall, fertilizers, and pesticides on crop yield.

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights production trends, state-wise contributions, and key factors influencing yield. The aim is to reveal how climatic conditions and agricultural inputs shape productivity over time.

ðŸ“Š **Dataset**

Fields Included:

Crop (e.g., Maize, Bajra, Tur, etc.)

Year (1997â€“2020)

Season (Kharif, Rabi, Autumn, etc.)

State (cultivation region)

Area (hectares)

Production (tons)

Annual Rainfall (mm)

Fertilizer & Pesticide usage (kg)

Yield (Production Ã· Area)

ðŸ“ˆ **Dashboard Highlights**

Key Metrics:

Total Production: ~324B

Cultivated Area: ~4B hectares

Rainfall: ~28.3M mm

Avg. Yield: ~79.95

Insights:

Production rose steadily (1997â€“2015), peaking around 2010â€“2015.

Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh are top contributors.

Rainfall strongly correlates with yield; Meghalaya shows high rainfall impact.

Fertilizer and pesticide use directly affect productivity.

ðŸš€**How to Use**

Explore yearly/state-wise production.

Filter by crop, state, or season for deeper insights.

Identify Drivers using Key Influencers (rainfall, fertilizer, pesticides).

Extend with weather or soil data for predictive modeling.

ðŸ”® **Future Enhancements**

Predictive yield modeling with ML.

Geospatial mapping of production.

Integration with live weather & market price APIs.

Policy-focused insights for crop planning.

ðŸŽ¯**Key Learnings**

Rainfall is the strongest determinant of yield.

States with optimized fertilizer use achieve higher productivity.

Seasonal variation heavily impacts outcomes.

Dashboards simplify complex agri-data into actionable insights.
